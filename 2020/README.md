# 🎄 Advent of Code 2020 🎄

## 🎄 Summary 🎄

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges.

### Setup 

First export your cookie session with AOC with the google chrome developer tools  (Literally just go copy the session key)  Then make a folder in your root titled `secret` and create a text file within called `cookie.txt`.  The .gitignore will ignore all text files / (and other formats) so it won't get loaded into github. 

### requirements 
| Library | Version | Usage |
|:---|:---:|---:| 
| numpy | >=2.3.5,<3.0.0          | For data manipulation |
| percache | >=0.4.4,<0.5.0       | For caching |
| rich | >=14.2.0,<15.0.0         | For terminal glory |
| requests | >=2.32.5,<3.0.0      | To talk to the webs |
| beautifulsoup4 | >=4.14.2,<5.0.0| To parse the webs |
| lxml | >=6.0.2,<7.0.0           | Parser language |
| matplotlib | >=3.10.7,<4.0.0    | For the plots |

If you're using VSCode your env can be tied to the year you're using by changing the default interpreter path.  In your root .vscode folder adjust the following.
